    "In the focal site multi-scale study framework <cite data-cite=\"brennen2002focal\"/>, a response variable (e.g., species abundance) is measured at multiple sites and the predictor variables are usually measures of landscape structure (e.g. habitat amount and configuration) computed at multiple spatial extents surrounding each focal site. The utility of such a framework transcends species-landscape relationships - in fact, land use regressions to predict air quality or temperature based on multi-scale spatial predictors fundamentally share the same setup <cite data-cite=\"hoek2008review\" />.\n",

    "More broadly, the focal site multi-scale framework can be applied to the study of any spatial phenomena for which we have a set of observations at multiple sites. Consider the"
